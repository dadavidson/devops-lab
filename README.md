# DevOps Lab

Welcome to my DevOps Lab repository. This repository contains hands-on exercises, labs, and experiments focused on DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Cloud Computing. The goal is to build practical skills, reinforce learning, and demonstrate applied knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## 📚 Learning Focus
- Linux administration and scripting
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration
- Cloud infrastructure fundamentals (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Monitoring, logging, and reliability practices

## 💡 How I Use This Repository
Each folder contains self-contained exercises or mini-projects that illustrate key concepts from my ongoing learning path. These include:
- Scripts and automation examples
- Containerized applications and deployments
- Cloud infrastructure experiments
- Notes and summaries of best practices

## 🚀 Goal
This repository serves as both a personal sandbox and a public demonstration of my evolving skills in DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Engineering.
